	abstract = {Current building code requirements for seismic design are primarily intended to minimize life-safety risks due to structural damage under extreme earthquakes. While tall buildings designed under current standards are expected to achieve the life-safety goal, this study estimates that they may require up to 7.5 months of repair to return to functionality after a design-level earthquake (roughly equivalent to ground motion shaking with a 10\% probability of exceedance in 50 years), and over 1 year after a risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake (roughly equivalent to ground motion shaking with a 2\%-4\% chance of exceedance in 50 years). These long downtimes, which correspond to median predictions, far exceed recovery goals for major employers and other recovery-critical uses and can have disproportionately harmful effects on businesses and residents. To address such extensive downtime risks, we evaluate the impact of recovery-based design guidelines for reducing recovery times through (1) more stringent drift limits under expected ground motions and (2) measures to mitigate externalities that impede recovery. The results suggest that by combining these strategies, expected recovery times following a design-level earthquake can be reduced to roughly 1 month, and to 2 months following a risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake. These findings are illustrated for an archetype 42-story reinforced concrete shear wall residential building and a 40-story steel buckling-restrained braced frame office building in San Francisco, CA.},

	abstract = {Tall residential RC shear wall buildings (RCSW), which are predominant in Metro Vancouver, have the potential to experience large magnitude earthquakes generated by the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Furthermore, the region lies above the Georgia sedimentary basin, which can amplify the intensity of ground motions at medium to long periods and the resulting damage in tall structures. This study provides insights into the effects of the Georgia sedimentary basin amplification on (1) spectral accelerations associated with magnitude 9 (M9) CSZ earthquakes, (2) resulting force- and deformation-controlled actions in modern tall RCSW buildings, and (3) ensuing earthquakeinduced repair costs and times. To this end, we leveraged a suite of physics-based ground motion simulations of a range of M9 CSZ earthquake scenarios, which explicitly consider basin effects, and benchmarked these scenarios against a range of seismic hazard intensities, which neglects basin effects. While the M9 simulations have an estimated 500-year return period, at deep basin sites their spectra exceed the 2,475-year hazard in the 1–3 s period range. Nonlinear dynamic analysis results under probabilistic seismic hazard estimates result in negligible collapse risk. In contrast, collapse risk conditioned on the occurrence of the M9 motions results in probabilities as high as 15\%. Additionally, seismic demands from the M9 simulations at deep basin sites result in earthquake-induced repair costs and times that exceed those associated with the 2,475-year hazard level.

	abstract = {Canada’s 2020 national seismic hazard model (CSHM 2020) provides hazard estimates for interface Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquakes in southwestern Canada using four ground motion models (GMMs) with equal weights. Two out of the four GMMs were derived using data primarily from subduction earthquakes in Japan so their use in CSHM 2020 includes a ‘‘Japan-to-Cascadia’’ factor to account for local site conditions. Despite this regional factor, the GMMs do not explicitly consider the amplification effects from the Georgia sedimentary basin below Metro Vancouver. This study benchmarks ground motion shaking from a suite of 30 physicsbased simulations of M9 CSZ earthquakes, which explicitly account for basin effects for periods exceeding 1 s, to corresponding estimates from interface GMMs in CSHM 2020. Using this comparison, this study proposes site-specific and perioddependent basin amplification factors for a range of sites located within the Georgia sedimentary basin. The average basin amplification factors at the deepest basin location reach values as high as 2.24 and 6.29 at a 2 s period with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin reference locations, respectively. We evaluate the proposed factors by comparing them against long-period amplifications observed in empirical strong motion recordings from the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake. A framework to incorporate the proposed basin amplification factors in the calculation of CSHM 2020 uniform hazard spectra (UHS) is also proposed. The modified UHS ordinates at the deepest basin location reach values that are 58\% to 271\% higher, at a 2 s period, than non-basin UHS estimates when amplification factors are calculated with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin reference locations, respectively.},

	abstract = {Southwest British Columbia has the potential to experience large-magnitude earthquakes generated by the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Buildings in Metro Vancouver are particularly vulnerable to these earthquakes because the region lies above the Georgia sedimentary basin, which can amplify the intensity of ground motions, particularly at medium-to-long periods. Earthquake design provisions in Canada neglect basin amplification and the consequences of accounting for these effects are uncertain. By leveraging a suite of physicsbased simulations of M9 CSZ earthquakes, we develop site-specific and perioddependent spectral acceleration basin amplification factors throughout Metro Vancouver. The M9 simulations, which explicitly account for basin amplification for periods greater than 1s, are benchmarked against the 2016 BC Hydro ground motion model (GMM), which neglects such effects. Outside the basin, empirical and simulated seismic hazard estimates are consistent. However, for sites within the basin and periods in the 1-5 s range, GMMs significantly underestimate the hazard. The proposed basin amplification factors vary as a function of basin depth, reaching a geometric mean value as high as 4.5 at a 2-s period, with respect to a reference site located just outside the basin. We evaluate the impact of the M9 simulations on tall reinforced concrete shear wall buildings, which are predominant in the region, by developing a suite of idealized structural systems that capture the strength and ductility intended by historical seismic design provisions in Canada. Ductility demands and collapse risk conditioned on the occurrence of the M9 simulations were found to exceed those associated with ground motion shaking intensities corresponding to the 975 and 2475-year return periods, far exceeding the ∼500-year return period of M9 CSZ earthquakes.},
