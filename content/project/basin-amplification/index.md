This project quantifies long-period spectral acceleration amplification due to the Georgia sedimentary basin in Metro Vancouver.

Using a suite of 30 broadband simulations of M9 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquakes, we benchmark ground motions against national models and derive period-dependent basin amplification factors (BAFs). These factors are validated using empirical data from the 2001 Nisqually earthquake and used to propose a framework for modifying Uniform Hazard Spectra (UHS) to better reflect the amplification effects.

The findings have implications for seismic hazard mapping, performance-based design, and future editions of the National Building Code of Canada.
