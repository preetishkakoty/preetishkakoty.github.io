    Earthquake scenarios are critical within the context of seismic risk assessments, supporting effective risk communication and informing long-term policy decisions for risk mitigation. They also enable detailed analysis of cascading hazards such as landslides, liquefaction, and tsunamis. Despite their utility, a standardized framework for selecting representative scenarios from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) models remains absent.

    This research addresses this gap by proposing a systematic framework to select representative earthquake scenarios using disaggregation data from national-scale PSHA models. A case study focused on Wellington, New Zealand, utilizing the 2022 national seismic hazard model, is presented to highlight the implementation of the framework. This study outlines the selection process, performs seismic hazard analysis for the selected deterministic scenarios, and conducts residual analysis to compare scenario-based hazard estimates with probabilistic models, exploring their relevance.
