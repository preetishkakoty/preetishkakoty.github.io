This project assesses the **collapse risk of older tall buildings in Vancouver** that use non-ductile reinforced concrete shear walls (RCSW). These buildingsâ€”constructed prior to ductile detailing requirements in the mid-1980sâ€”house thousands of residents, many of whom are low-income or elderly.

The study proposes a **data-driven archetype generation framework** using a random forest regression model trained on a detailed inventory of 350 buildings. It creates 25 archetypes across five height categories (10â€“30 stories) and models each using nonlinear response history analysis under hazard-consistent ground motions.
