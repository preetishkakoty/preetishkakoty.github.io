This collaborative project gathers information across domains to build a comprehensive picture of seismic risk in Wellington. Contributions include hazard modelling, infrastructure exposure, vulnerability assessments, and community preparedness studies â€” across both regional and national scopes.

The review will form the basis for a co-authored paper highlighting the current state of knowledge, gaps in data and modeling approaches, and opportunities for integrated seismic risk modelling in Wellington. It invites participation from researchers and practitioners across disciplines to develop an open and shared foundation for future risk reduction efforts.
