#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My research seeks to understand impacts of natural hazard events on our communities, and thereby seek to enable decisions for a resilient future. My research delves into questions in the intersection of natural hazards simulation, structural engineering, risk quantification, and decision science.  

With a background in structural and systems engineering, I use statistical and physics based simulation tools to understand the complexities of disaster risk. My approach has been to work with collaborative teams with diversity in expertise and experience, and thereby engage in discussions related to policy decisions that aim to reduce risk. 

When I’m not reading on my computer, I’m likely off traveling to a new destination or experimenting in the kitchen with exotic recipes.
