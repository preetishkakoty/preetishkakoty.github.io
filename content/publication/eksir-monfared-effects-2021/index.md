abstract: 'Tall residential RC shear wall buildings (RCSW), which are predominant
  in Metro Vancouver, have the potential to experience large magnitude earthquakes
  generated by the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Furthermore, the region lies above
  the Georgia sedimentary basin, which can amplify the intensity of ground motions
  at medium to long periods and the resulting damage in tall structures. This study
  provides insights into the effects of the Georgia sedimentary basin amplification
  on (1) spectral accelerations associated with magnitude 9 (M9) CSZ earthquakes,
  (2) resulting force- and deformation-controlled actions in modern tall RCSW buildings,
  and (3) ensuing earthquakeinduced repair costs and times. To this end, we leveraged
  a suite of physics-based ground motion simulations of a range of M9 CSZ earthquake
  scenarios, which explicitly consider basin effects, and benchmarked these scenarios
  against a range of seismic hazard intensities, which neglects basin effects. While
  the M9 simulations have an estimated 500-year return period, at deep basin sites
  their spectra exceed the 2,475-year hazard in the 1–3 s period range. Nonlinear
  dynamic analysis results under probabilistic seismic hazard estimates result in
  negligible collapse risk. In contrast, collapse risk conditioned on the occurrence
  of the M9 motions results in probabilities as high as 15%. Additionally, seismic
  demands from the M9 simulations at deep basin sites result in earthquake-induced
  repair costs and times that exceed those associated with the 2,475-year hazard level.
