 abstract = {Canada’s 2020 national seismic hazard model (CSHM 2020) provides hazard estimates for interface Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquakes in southwestern Canada using four ground motion models (GMMs) with equal weights. Two out of the four GMMs were derived using data primarily from subduction earthquakes in Japan so their use in CSHM 2020 includes a ‘‘Japan-to-Cascadia’’ factor to account for local site conditions. Despite this regional factor, the GMMs do not explicitly consider the amplification effects from the Georgia sedimentary basin below Metro Vancouver. This study benchmarks ground motion shaking from a suite of 30 physicsbased simulations of M9 CSZ earthquakes, which explicitly account for basin effects for periods exceeding 1 s, to corresponding estimates from interface GMMs in CSHM 2020. Using this comparison, this study proposes site-specific and perioddependent basin amplification factors for a range of sites located within the Georgia sedimentary basin. The average basin amplification factors at the deepest basin location reach values as high as 2.24 and 6.29 at a 2 s period with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin reference locations, respectively. We evaluate the proposed factors by comparing them against long-period amplifications observed in empirical strong motion recordings from the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake. A framework to incorporate the proposed basin amplification factors in the calculation of CSHM 2020 uniform hazard spectra (UHS) is also proposed. The modified UHS ordinates at the deepest basin location reach values that are 58% to 271% higher, at a 2 s period, than non-basin UHS estimates when amplification factors are calculated with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin reference locations, respectively.},
