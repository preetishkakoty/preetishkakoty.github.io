abstract: Canada’s 2020 national seismic hazard model (CSHM 2020) provides hazard
  estimates for interface Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquakes in southwestern
  Canada using four ground motion models (GMMs) with equal weights. Two out of the
  four GMMs were derived using data primarily from subduction earthquakes in Japan
  so their use in CSHM 2020 includes a ‘‘Japan-to-Cascadia’’ factor to account for
  local site conditions. Despite this regional factor, the GMMs do not explicitly
  consider the amplification effects from the Georgia sedimentary basin below Metro
  Vancouver. This study benchmarks ground motion shaking from a suite of 30 physicsbased
  simulations of M9 CSZ earthquakes, which explicitly account for basin effects for
  periods exceeding 1 s, to corresponding estimates from interface GMMs in CSHM 2020.
  Using this comparison, this study proposes site-specific and perioddependent basin
  amplification factors for a range of sites located within the Georgia sedimentary
  basin. The average basin amplification factors at the deepest basin location reach
  values as high as 2.24 and 6.29 at a 2 s period with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin
  reference locations, respectively. We evaluate the proposed factors by comparing
  them against long-period amplifications observed in empirical strong motion recordings
  from the 2001 M6.8 Nisqually earthquake. A framework to incorporate the proposed
  basin amplification factors in the calculation of CSHM 2020 uniform hazard spectra
  (UHS) is also proposed. The modified UHS ordinates at the deepest basin location
  reach values that are 58% to 271% higher, at a 2 s period, than non-basin UHS estimates
  when amplification factors are calculated with respect to basin-edge and outside-basin
  reference locations, respectively.
