---

This study presents a comprehensive seismic collapse risk assessment of tall, older reinforced concrete shear wall (RCSW) buildings in Vancouver that lack ductile detailing. These structures, built prior to modern seismic code requirements, represent a high-consequence class of buildingsâ€”often with large occupancies and vulnerable residents.

The research introduces a **data-driven archetype generation framework**, trained on a 350-building inventory, and creates 25 representative building models across five height categories. Using nonlinear response-history analysis and basin-amplified ground motion simulations, the study computes collapse fragility curves for each archetype.

The work supports a shift toward regional, archetype-specific risk models to inform targeted seismic retrofit strategies.
