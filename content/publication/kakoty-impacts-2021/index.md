abstract: Southwest British Columbia has the potential to experience large-magnitude
  earthquakes generated by the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Buildings in Metro
  Vancouver are particularly vulnerable to these earthquakes because the region lies
  above the Georgia sedimentary basin, which can amplify the intensity of ground motions,
  particularly at medium-to-long periods. Earthquake design provisions in Canada neglect
  basin amplification and the consequences of accounting for these effects are uncertain.
  By leveraging a suite of physicsbased simulations of M9 CSZ earthquakes, we develop
  site-specific and perioddependent spectral acceleration basin amplification factors
  throughout Metro Vancouver. The M9 simulations, which explicitly account for basin
  amplification for periods greater than 1s, are benchmarked against the 2016 BC Hydro
  ground motion model (GMM), which neglects such effects. Outside the basin, empirical
  and simulated seismic hazard estimates are consistent. However, for sites within
  the basin and periods in the 1-5 s range, GMMs significantly underestimate the hazard.
  The proposed basin amplification factors vary as a function of basin depth, reaching
  a geometric mean value as high as 4.5 at a 2-s period, with respect to a reference
  site located just outside the basin. We evaluate the impact of the M9 simulations
  on tall reinforced concrete shear wall buildings, which are predominant in the region,
  by developing a suite of idealized structural systems that capture the strength
  and ductility intended by historical seismic design provisions in Canada. Ductility
  demands and collapse risk conditioned on the occurrence of the M9 simulations were
  found to exceed those associated with ground motion shaking intensities corresponding
  to the 975 and 2475-year return periods, far exceeding the âˆ¼500-year return period
  of M9 CSZ earthquakes.
