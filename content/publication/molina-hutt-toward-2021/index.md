abstract: Current building code requirements for seismic design are primarily intended
  to minimize life-safety risks due to structural damage under extreme earthquakes.
  While tall buildings designed under current standards are expected to achieve the
  life-safety goal, this study estimates that they may require up to 7.5 months of
  repair to return to functionality after a design-level earthquake (roughly equivalent
  to ground motion shaking with a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years), and
  over 1 year after a risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake (roughly equivalent
  to ground motion shaking with a 2%-4% chance of exceedance in 50 years). These long
  downtimes, which correspond to median predictions, far exceed recovery goals for
  major employers and other recovery-critical uses and can have disproportionately
  harmful effects on businesses and residents. To address such extensive downtime
  risks, we evaluate the impact of recovery-based design guidelines for reducing recovery
  times through (1) more stringent drift limits under expected ground motions and
  (2) measures to mitigate externalities that impede recovery. The results suggest
  that by combining these strategies, expected recovery times following a design-level
  earthquake can be reduced to roughly 1 month, and to 2 months following a risk-targeted
  maximum considered earthquake. These findings are illustrated for an archetype 42-story
  reinforced concrete shear wall residential building and a 40-story steel buckling-restrained
  braced frame office building in San Francisco, CA.
