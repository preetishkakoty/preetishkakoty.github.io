I am honored to have received a [**Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship**](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/about-msca) for a proposal titled "Resilience Enhancement through Multi-Hazard Recovery Analysis of Earthquake and Flood-Affected Infrastructure". I will move to [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in January 2026 to start this project with [Professor Carmine Galasso](https://www.carminegalassoresearch.com/).
