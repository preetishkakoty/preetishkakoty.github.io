A busy week in Milan attending the [18th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering](https://www.wcee2024.it/).

I presented on "Quantifying Variability in the Collapse Risk of Non-ductile Reinforced Concrete Shear Wall Buildings” in a session titled [**Seismic Resilience of Aging Communities**](https://program.wcee2024.it/?mode=session&id=ASR14). This work is part of my PhD project [Collapse Risk of Non-Ductile Concrete Shear Wall Buildings](/project/non-ductile-concrete/).

I also contributed to a paper "Earthquake insurance penetration in India: opportunities and challenges" that was presented by the lead author [Pratim Kalita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratim-parash-kalita-5b4627b0/) during the conference.

Additionally, I co-organized a session titled [**Seismic Risk Models for Decision Support: Advancements and Applications**](https://d10qmes3r0zm40.cloudfront.net/wcee2024-congress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/03094601/WCEE2024_SHR-1.pdf) hosting ~40 presentations over multiple sessions. This session was co-organized with Tiegan Hobbs (Geological Survey of Canada) and Robert Chase (Lettis Consultants International).
