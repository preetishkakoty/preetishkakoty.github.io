It was great to participate in the [**2025 Taiwan-Japan-New Zealand Seismic Hazard Assessment Workshop**](https://2025tw-jp-nz.earth.sinica.edu.tw/), where experts and leaders in the three countries and beyond shared updates on various aspects of modelling and application in respective national models. Discussions covered a wide variety of topics, including time-dependent earthquake models, nonlinear soil modelling, nonergodic ground-motion models, temporal variability in fault slip rates, physics-based ground motion simulation and applications among others.

A particularly memorable part of the workshop was the organized field trip to Hualien on Taiwan’s east coast, which experienced an Mw 7.4 earthquake in April 2024. We visited the MiDAS research facility, where distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology has been deployed along the Milun Fault. We observed preserved ground displacements from the 2024 earthquake and saw art installations that commemorate the event and raise community awareness. On the second day we explored Taroko National Park and visited multiple sites where co-seismic landslides altered the landscape. The park visitor centre hosted a thoughtfully presented exhibit documenting the damage and recovery, highlighting community efforts to restore the landscape, including replanting native species uprooted by the landslides. Although the park is not yet fully functional, the visit served as a powerful reminder of how profoundly such events affect regions and communities.

The [**Global Travel Grant**](https://www.seismosoc.org/awards/global-travel-grant/) made this entire experience possible, and I am deeply thankful to the Seismological Society of America for their support.
