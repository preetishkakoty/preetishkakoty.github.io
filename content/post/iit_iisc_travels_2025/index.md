I delivered a presentation titled "Peeling the Layers of Earthquake Risk: Hazards, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Tolerability" at IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore during October, 2025.  The presentation focused on how risk models often serve as heiristics to guide risk–reduction policy decisions, which makes it especially critical that risk modelers play a larger role in interpreting and communicating results. That responsibility includes clearly explaining model limitations and the challenges of keeping models up to date as knowledge evolves. Ultimately, what constitutes an acceptable or tolerable level of risk is a personal choice that differs for each stakeholder.
  
The presentation included material that is part of [Earthquake Risk Tolerance for Building Codes](/project/risk-tolerance-building-codes/) funded by [Natural Hazards Commission Toka Tū Ake](https://www.naturalhazards.govt.nz/).
