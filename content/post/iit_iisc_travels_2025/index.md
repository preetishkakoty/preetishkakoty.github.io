I was pleased to present "Peeling the Layers of Earthquake Risk: Hazards, Exposure, Vulnerability, and Tolerability" at the Indian Institution of Technology Bombay and Indian Institute of Science Bangalore during October, 2005.  The presentation emphasized how risk models inform disaster risk–reduction policy. As modelers, our work often focuses on building models and interpreting their results into forms decision makers, both individuals and institutions, can use. Model outputs therefore serve mainly as heuristics to guide decisions, which makes it especially critical that risk modelers play a larger role in interpreting and communicating results. That responsibility includes clearly explaining model limitations and the challenges of keeping models up to date as knowledge evolves. Ultimately, what constitutes an acceptable or tolerable level of risk is a personal choice that differs for each stakeholder.
  
The presentation included material that is part of [risk-tolerance-building-codes](/project/risk-tolerance-building-codes/) funded by [Natural Hazards Commission Toka Tū Ake](https://www.naturalhazards.govt.nz/).
